# Product-Analysis-Discovery


As a product analyst, you would often rely on various Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy to analyze and interpret data. Here's a rundown of some essential Python formulas and techniques commonly used to investigate business evolution:

# **1. Growth Rate Calculation**

To calculate the growth rate between two periods, you might use:

growth_rate = ((value_end - value_start) / value_start) * 100

# **2. Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)**

CAGR is used to understand the mean annual growth rate of an investment over a specified time period longer than one year. It represents one of the most accurate ways to calculate and determine returns for anything that can rise or fall in value over time.

CAGR = ((final_value / initial_value) ** (1 / number_of_years)) - 1


# **3. Moving Average**

A moving average helps smooth out price data over a specified period by creating a constantly updated average price. This is useful for identifying trends. Pandas makes it easy:

**Using Pandas DataFrame 'df' and calculating the moving average for 'n' periods on 'price' column**
moving_average = df['price'].rolling(window=n).mean()


# **4. Standard Deviation**

Standard deviation measures the dispersion of a dataset relative to its mean. A high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range.

standard_deviation = df['column_name'].std()


# **5. Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)**

CLTV predicts the net profit attributed to the entire future relationship with a customer.

CLTV = average_order_value * purchase_frequency * customer_lifespan


# **6. Conversion Rate**

The conversion rate is the percentage of users who take a desired action, crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of marketing campaigns or website design changes.

conversion_rate = (number_of_conversions / total_visitors) * 100


# **7. Churn Rate**

Churn rate, or the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity, is crucial for understanding customer retention.

churn_rate = (customers_at_start - customers_at_end) / customers_at_start * 100


# **8. A/B Testing (Hypothesis Testing)**

Used to compare two versions of a web page, app, or other product deliverables to determine which one performs better. You would typically use a statistical test for this, like a t-test.

from scipy import stats

# Assuming you have two samples: a_control and b_variant
t_stat, p_val = stats.ttest_ind(a_control, b_variant)


# 9. Regression Analysis

For investigating the relationship between a dependent (target) and one (simple regression) or more (multiple regression) independent variables.

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

X = df[['independent_variable']]
y = df['dependent_variable']

model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)
